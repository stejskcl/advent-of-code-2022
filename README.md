C++ solutions to 2022 adventofcode.com challenge

## Solutions
The solutions for each day are located in the file dayx.cpp.
Each input is located in the input/dayx.txt.
Since inputs are unique to each account, you must populate this folder with your own inputs.

## Helpful shell scripts
I made these to ease the process of setting up for each day.
The files are configured for Mac / Visual Studio, but you can create something similar for yourself.

To initialize files and open the links for a day (1-25), run
    $ ./init.sh [day]

To compile and run file for day (1-25), run
    $ ./run.sh [day]
